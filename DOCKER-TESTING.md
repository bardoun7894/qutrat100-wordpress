- **Services**: 
  - MySQL 8.0 database
  - WordPress 6.4 with PHP 8.1 and Apache
  - phpMyAdmin for database management

### Key Configuration Details

#### Database Service
- **Image**: mysql:8.0
- **Port**: 3307 (mapped from 3306)
- **Database**: wordpress
- **Credentials**: wordpress/wordpress
- **Character Set**: utf8mb4 with unicode collation

#### WordPress Service
- **Image**: wordpress:6.4-php8.1-apache
- **Port**: 8080 (mapped from 80)

- No port conflicts or service issues
- Proper inter-container communication established

### ✅ WordPress Installation
- WordPress installation page loads correctly at http://localhost:8080
- Database connection established successfully
- All WordPress core functionality accessible

### ✅ Quiz Application Testing
- **Standalone Quiz**: http://localhost:8080/quiz.php ✅
  - Quiz interface loads properly
  - Arabic text displays correctly
  - Interactive elements functional
  
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8080/admin.php ✅
  - Admin interface accessible
  - Question management system working
  - Database operations functional

### ✅ File System Integration
- All custom PHP files properly mounted
- Assets (CSS, JS, images) loading correctly
- API endpoints accessible
- Upload directory writable

## Verified Components

### Core Application Files
- ✅ quiz.php - Main quiz interface
- ✅ admin.php - Administrative panel
- ✅ demo.php - Demo functionality
- ✅ page-quiz.php - WordPress page template
- ✅ wp-quiz-api.php - API endpoints

### Supporting Directories
- ✅ includes/ - Database and utility functions
- ✅ api/ - REST API endpoints
- ✅ assets/ - CSS, JavaScript, and images
- ✅ uploads/ - File upload directory

### WordPress Integration
- ✅ wp-content/themes/qudrat100-theme-complete/
- ✅ wp-content/plugins/arabic-quiz-system/
- ✅ WordPress core files and functionality

## Performance Observations

### Container Resource Usage
- MySQL container: Stable, responsive
- WordPress container: Good performance with PHP 8.1
- phpMyAdmin: Accessible and functional

### Application Performance
- Quiz loading time: Fast
- Admin panel responsiveness: Good
- Database queries: Efficient
- Arabic text rendering: Proper

## Network Configuration

### Port Mapping
- WordPress: localhost:8080
- phpMyAdmin: localhost:8081
- MySQL: localhost:3307 (for external access)

### Internal Communication
- WordPress ↔ MySQL: db:3306 (internal Docker network)
- phpMyAdmin ↔ MySQL: db:3306 (internal Docker network)

## Security Considerations

### Development Environment
- Debug mode enabled (appropriate for testing)
- Unfiltered uploads allowed (development only)
- Default credentials used (testing environment)

### Production Recommendations
- Disable debug mode
- Implement proper file upload restrictions
- Use strong, unique credentials
- Enable SSL/TLS encryption
- Implement proper backup strategies

## Troubleshooting Notes

### Common Issues Resolved
1. **Character encoding**: Resolved with utf8mb4 collation
2. **File permissions**: Resolved with FS_METHOD = 'direct'
3. **Memory limits**: Increased to handle quiz operations
4. **Arabic language**: Properly configured with WPLANG setting

### Container Health
- All containers running and healthy
- No memory or CPU issues observed
- Persistent data storage working correctly

## Deployment Readiness

### Docker Environment Status: ✅ READY
- All core functionality tested and working
- Database operations verified
- File system integration confirmed
- Multi-language support validated

### Next Steps for Production
1. Update security configurations
2. Implement SSL certificates
3. Configure production database credentials
4. Set up automated backups
5. Implement monitoring and logging

## Test Completion Summary

**Date**: Current testing session
**Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED
**Environment**: Docker containers on Windows with XAMPP
**Verdict**: Application is fully functional in containerized environment

The WordPress quiz application has been successfully tested in a Docker environment and is ready for containerized deployment. All major components are working correctly, including the standalone quiz interface, administrative panel, and WordPress integration.
